# container

A series of programming environments installed with a default set of packages I
commonly use.

Currently the following are semi-actively maintained (na√Øvely using GitHub
    Actions):
  - Conda, this comes pre-installed with JupyterLab and the JupyterLab LSP.
  - Julia, based on the Conda image, this comes with everything in
    [Project.toml][Project.toml].
  - Python, based on the Conda image, this comes with everything in
    [env.yml][env.yml].

[Project.toml]: julia/root/.julia/environments/base/Project.toml
[env.yml]: python/root/env.yml
