# Containers

A series of programming environments installed with a default set of packages I commonly use.

Currently the following are semi-actively maintained (na√Øvely using GitHub Actions):

- Conda, this comes pre-installed with JupyterLab and the JupyterLab LSP.
- Julia, based on the Conda image, this comes with everything in Project.toml.
- Python, based on the Conda image, this comes with everything in env.yml.
